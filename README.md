## üëã Hi! 

I‚Äôm Simon, a Creative Technologist and UI Developer with a decade of curiosity-driven work building tools & prototypes that blur the lines between design and engineering. Whether I‚Äôm crafting playful micro-animations for Hilton‚Äôs booking platform, prototyping voice interactions (like the patented system I helped create at Dell!), or experimenting with retail displays to solve real-world challenges, my focus is always on ‚ÄúHow can we make this more intuitive & joyful?‚Äù

A few things I‚Äôm proud of:

- Joined the 2024 Hilton Hackathon and built a collection of micro-animated UI components to enhance visual engagement across their booking platform.
- Created designer-friendly tools to easily integrate dynamic content into ad campaigns, reducing production time by half.
- Contributed to a patented system at Dell that re-imagined how users interact with voice commands in real-time applications.
